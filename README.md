# Notes
- Implementation **does not** have to be pixel-perfect to the provided mock ups; you can also make changes you believe would improve readability, accessibility, etc. We're will focus more on the final product than on accuracy, but may ask about the rationale behind large changes.
- A base Vue 3 + Bootstrap Vue installation is provided, but feel free to use your preference of framework or libraries.
- Base components containing the required text is provided. Feel free to change the HTML or create new files, but all text in the component must be used.
